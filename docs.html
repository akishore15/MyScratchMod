        <p>You can make a Scratch mod in three steps. First, you can go to my GitHub and copy the source code and edit the h1 element and the title element to whatever you want! Secondly, you can run the code in a code editor. Then, you can publish it on GitHub (post it on the issues page, please!) .</p>
